Note that this little demo do not handle multiple connexions, you have to deal with multiples instances of TWebSocket.

If you want to exchange JSON data, you can use my [JSON Unit](https://github.com/tothpaul/LetsEncryptDelphi/blob/master/lib/Execute.JSON.pas) for  instance.

You can also request integration support to [Execute](http://www.execute.fr).
